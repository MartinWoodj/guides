## Sketch

Sketch is a design toolkit for macOS only. It quickly became very popular as an alternative to Photoshop for user interface design as it's much cheaper and has a low learning curve.

### Why Sketch?

* Easily reuse elements
* Collaborate with others
* Lots of plugins
* Export files in multiple formats
* Vast community

### Why Should I Switch To Sketch?

Sketch is designed to build digital products rather than editing photos and print graphics. Sketch's clean interface helps keep you organized when mocking up or building out your UI/UX designs. The art boards that Sketch uses enforces a pixel grid for precise designs. Exporting designs is simple and supports different device resolutions.
